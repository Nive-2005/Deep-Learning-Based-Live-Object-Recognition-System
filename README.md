# Deep-Learning-Based-Live-Object-Recognition-System
This project implements a real-time object recognition system using MATLAB and a pretrained GoogLeNet deep learning model. Live images are captured through a camera, resized, and classified into object categories. The predicted object name and confidence score are displayed, demonstrating practical CNN-based image classification.
